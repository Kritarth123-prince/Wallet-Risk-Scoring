# Wallet Risk Scoring for Aave V2 Protocol

## Problem Statement
Develop a risk assessment system for wallet addresses to evaluate their creditworthiness and potential default risk in the Aave V2 lending protocol. The system should analyze on-chain behavior patterns to generate risk scores between 100-950.

## Data Collection Method

### Primary Data Sources
- **Etherscan API**: Real-time on-chain transaction data
- **Transaction History**: Complete wallet activity timeline
- **Balance Information**: Current ETH holdings
- **Temporal Analysis**: Wallet creation and activity patterns

### Data Points Extracted
```python
def get_wallet_metrics(address):
    # Transaction count (activity level)
    tx_count = get_transaction_count(address)
    
    # Current ETH balance (liquidity indicator)
    eth_balance = get_balance(address)
    
    # Wallet age (experience factor)
    wallet_age = calculate_age_from_first_tx(address)
```

## Feature Selection Rationale

### Transaction Volume Analysis
**Rationale**: Higher transaction frequency indicates sophisticated users but also potential risks:
- Advanced DeFi strategies may lead to complex liquidation scenarios
- Bot activity suggests automated risk-taking behavior
- Frequent trading patterns correlate with higher volatility exposure

### Balance-Based Risk Assessment
**Rationale**: Account balance reflects financial stability and commitment:
- **Low balances** (<0.01 ETH): "Dust" accounts with minimal skin in the game
- **High balances** (>500 ETH): Whale accounts capable of market manipulation
- **Moderate balances**: Generally indicate stable, genuine users

### Temporal Risk Factors
**Rationale**: Wallet age serves as a proxy for experience and reliability:
- New wallets lack historical behavioral data
- Established wallets demonstrate sustained engagement
- Age correlates with understanding of DeFi risks

## Scoring Methodology

### Base Risk Score: 400
Starting point representing neutral risk profile for Aave V2 interactions.

### Risk Adjustment Formula
```python
def calculate_risk_score(tx_count, balance, age_days):
    risk_score = 400  # baseline
    
    # Transaction frequency penalties
    if tx_count > 2000: risk_score += 200    # Heavy traders
    elif tx_count > 1000: risk_score += 120  # Active traders
    elif tx_count > 500: risk_score += 80    # Regular traders
    elif tx_count > 100: risk_score += 40    # Casual traders
    
    # Balance-based adjustments
    if balance < 0.01: risk_score += 150      # Dust wallets
    elif balance > 500: risk_score += 100    # Whale wallets
    elif balance > 100: risk_score += 50     # Large holders
    
    # Age-based penalties (newer = riskier)
    if age_days < 7: risk_score += 180       # Brand new
    elif age_days < 30: risk_score += 120    # Very new
    elif age_days < 90: risk_score += 80     # New
    elif age_days < 365: risk_score += 40    # Relatively new
    
    return min(max(risk_score, 100), 950)
```

## Risk Indicators Justification

### High Transaction Volume (>2000 transactions)
**Risk Level**: Extreme (+200 points)
**Justification**: 
- Indicates algorithmic trading or MEV strategies
- Higher likelihood of leveraged positions
- Potential for rapid portfolio changes affecting collateral ratios

### Balance Extremes
**Dust Accounts** (<0.01 ETH):
- **Risk Level**: High (+150 points)
- **Justification**: Minimal financial commitment, likely to abandon positions

**Whale Accounts** (>500 ETH):
- **Risk Level**: Significant (+100 points)
- **Justification**: Capable of market manipulation, systemic risk to protocol

### Wallet Age Factor
**New Wallets** (<7 days):
- **Risk Level**: Very High (+180 points)
- **Justification**: No established behavior pattern, higher probability of experimentation

**Recent Wallets** (<365 days):
- **Risk Level**: Moderate (+40 points)
- **Justification**: Limited market cycle experience

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Functions
```python
# Simplified implementation
def get_metrics(addr):
    api = os.getenv('ETHERSCAN_API_KEY')
    base = 'https://api.etherscan.io/api'
    
    tx = int(requests.get(f'{base}?module=proxy&action=eth_getTransactionCount&address={addr}&apikey={api}').json()['result'], 16)
    bal = int(requests.get(f'{base}?module=account&action=balance&address={addr}&apikey={api}').json()['result']) / 1e18
    hist = requests.get(f'{base}?module=account&action=txlist&address={addr}&page=1&offset=1&sort=asc&apikey={api}').json()['result']
    
    age = (time.time() - int(hist[0]['timeStamp'])) / 86400 if hist else 0
    return tx, bal, age

def score(tx, bal, age):
    s = 400
    s += 200 if tx > 2000 else 120 if tx > 1000 else 80 if tx > 500 else 40 if tx > 100 else 0
    s += 150 if bal < 0.01 else 100 if bal > 500 else 50 if bal > 100 else 0
    s += 180 if age < 7 else 120 if age < 30 else 80 if age < 90 else 40 if age < 365 else 0
    return min(s, 950)
```

## Expected Output Format
```csv
wallet_id,score
0xfaa0768bde629806739c3a4620656c5d26f44ef2,732
```

## Risk Score Interpretation for Aave V2

### Low Risk (100-400)
- Established wallets with moderate activity
- Suitable for standard lending terms
- Lower collateralization requirements

### Medium Risk (400-600)
- Some concerning patterns identified
- Standard lending with enhanced monitoring
- Regular collateral ratio checks

### High Risk (600-950)
- Multiple risk factors present
- Higher collateralization requirements
- Potential lending restrictions or enhanced terms

## Protocol Integration Considerations

### Automated Decision Making
Risk scores can be integrated into Aave V2's lending algorithms to:
- Adjust interest rates dynamically
- Modify liquidation thresholds
- Implement tiered access controls

### Continuous Monitoring
Regular rescoring enables:
- Portfolio risk assessment updates
- Early warning systems for defaults
- Adaptive risk management strategies
